OrionNodeRiak

A Websocket server for Node using Riak as a back end.

Features: 
 - Session support
 - Authentication support
 - Automated updates pushed to clients

Written with a sproutcore application in mind.

Status: Alpha... 
	There is client side code to test the setup, which is not included in the project yet.
	Please feel free to contact me to get it.
	
	What works: 
		- WebSocket connections in a WebSocket enabled browser
		- Authentication from userdata in a file
		- Session support
		- Automatic distribution of changes based on previous requests
	
	What still needs to be implemented:
		- support for sending queries to the server
		- support for more Riak features in requests to the server
		- additional authentication modules
		- binary data support
		- SC.DataSource client code
